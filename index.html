<h2><strong>History of W2XG</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Highbridge Station</strong></h3>
<p>The first iteration of the call existed as "2XG" from 1915 until 1923 as "Highbridge Station" out of 1391 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx, New York City, licensed to the De Forest Radio Telephone and Telegraph Company. It has its own Wikipedia article:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_2XG">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_2XG</a>, but was notably famous for being the first vacuum-tube powered station station to regularly broadcast phone news and entertainment on a consistent schedule. It operated on 375kHz with 125 watts. It went silent from 1917-1919 during World War 1, then resumed programming until the early 20's, when 2XG's transmitter was confiscated by district Radio Inspector&nbsp;Arthur Batcheller for an unauthorized relocation from the Bronx to Manhattan.</p>
<p>In the Radio Service Bulletin of July 1, 1924, the callsign was deleted.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Ocean Township, New Jersey</h3>
<p>Later that year, in the Radio Service Bulletin of December 1, 1924, the callsign "2XG" was added, located in "Ocean Beach, NJ" and licensed to&nbsp;"Western Electric Co., 463 West Street, New York, NY."</p>
<p>In the Radio Service Bulletin of February 2, 1925, the operator and controller was changed to "Bell Telephone Laboratories."&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February 1927,&nbsp;S. Williamson of Meersbrook, Sheffield, England, copied a transatlantic broadcast of 2XG.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1928, it was reported as operating on 32 meters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the middle of the 20th century, a broadcast station known as "2XG" operated out of New Zealand, unrelated to this callsign.</p>
